# BrainGFX

BrainGFX is a 2D version of the popular esoteric language Brainf***. BrainGFX consists of a grid of cells which can be manipulated. Each cell contains a number and each number corresponds to some colour which can be printed on the screen.

BrainGFX is an improved version of the [GBF](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Graphical_Brainfuck) idea.

### Execution

Download and extract the zip file. Then navigate to the directory containing the `cc` folder and type the following in the terminal

    $ javac cc/inversion/braingfx/BrainGFX.java
    $ java cc.inversion.braingfx.BrainGFX

### Commands

Cell's default maximum size is set to 256 and the image is 32x32.

- `+` increment the cell's value by 1. Value stored is modulo cell's maximum value.
- `-` decrement the cell's value by 1. Value stored is modulo cell's maximum value. Note that -1 = 255 mod 256.
- `.` prints the colour of the cell to the correspoding pixel (explained below).
- `<` perform action one (explained below).
- `>` perform action two (explaiend below).
- `[` if the current cell's value is 0, jump to the matching `]` bracket. Else ignore it.
- `]` if the current cell's value is not 0, jump to the matching `[` bracket. Else ignore it.
- `/` increments the mode by 1. Value stored is modulo 4.
- `\` decrements the mode by 1. Value stored is modulo 4.

#### Modes

There are four modes. In each mode, action one and action two makes pointer perform different things.

|            | Mode 0 | Mode 1 | Mode 2 | Mode 3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Action one | Left   | Up     | Right  | Down   |
| Action two | Right  | Down   | Left   | Up     |

Any action wraps across edges. So if you move right from the cell on the right edge, you end up on the cell on the left edge.

Note that increasing the mode basically turns the operations clockwise (and vice versa for decreasing the mode). So mode 0 action 2 is right while mode 1 action 2 is down.

### Command Line Arguments

- `W` or `width`    : set image width
- `H` or `height`   : set image height
- `Z` or `zoom`     : set zoom
- `S` or `cellsize` : set cell's maximum value

Example:

    $ java cc.inversion.braingfx.BrainGFX --W=12 --height=90 --Z=9

|           | Default Value  |
|-----------|----------------|
| Width     | 32             |
| Height    | 32             |
| Zoom      | 12             |
| Cell Size | 256            |

### Palette

3 bit, 8 color palette is used.

- ![0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/0.jpg) `0` : `#000000`
- ![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/1.jpg) `1` : `#0000FF`
- ![2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/2.jpg) `2` : `#00FF00`
- ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/3.jpg) `3` : `#00FFFF`
- ![4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/4.jpg) `4` : `#FF0000`
- ![5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/5.jpg) `5` : `#FF00FF`
- ![6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/6.jpg) `6` : `#FFFF00`
- ![7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inversioncc/BrainGFX/master/colours/7.jpg) `7 - 255` : `#FFFFFF`

### Known Problems

Don't accidentally run into an infinite loop or the program will crash. If you do run into crash, you will not be able to access the code that you wrote. However, don't panic. Code will be printed on the terminal after every run.

### Debugging

To help debug programs, raw code, cell grid and pointer location (0 indexed) will be printed on the terminal screen after every code execution.

### Future Plans

Samples section contains a number of cool finished and unfinished code ideas.

A JavaScript clone of this would also be wonderful.

Some delay and frame drawing mechanisms can be added to this language to allow animation capabilities.
